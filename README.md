# masterthesis
In course of my master thesis I created a software test visualization system to visualize the resukts of automatic software tests.

To use the program to visualize automatic software test results, the following data is needed:

1. Tested system
2. Name of the test
3. Test result
4. Date of the test
5. Runtime of the test

This data is needed in a form of a CSV file.
